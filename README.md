JavaHTTPServer
==============

An HTTP Server in Java. This server was created to pass certain specifications in the cob_spec repo.  The cob_spec is constantly changing and having new features added.  When I finished the server it passed all the cob_spec requirements.  At this point I could almost guarantee that it would be broken.  It is still a good demonstration of an HTTP server that can...
+ read directory links from a page
+ parse out query strings
+ read contents from files
+ return a 404 when appropriate
+ can read images
+ returns method not allowed when appropriate
+ performs url parameter decoding
+ can return a 206 for partial content
+ handles post data
+ handles redirects
+ handles simple GET requests
+ handles simple POST requests
+ handles simple PUT requests
